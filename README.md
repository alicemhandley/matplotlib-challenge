Background

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

Analysis

1. This data shows that the most effective drug regimens are Capomulin and Ramicane, indicated by the lowest final tumor volumes in the box plots below. 

2. The study has roughly equal numbers of males and females, as shown in the pie chart below, suggesting a good gender balance amongst the study participants.

3. There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, implying that as the mouse weight increases so does the tumor volume. This can be seen in the scatter plots below.
